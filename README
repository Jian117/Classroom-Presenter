With Classroom Presenter for the XO, a deck of slides can be distributed from the teacher's computer to each stuedn't XO, where the students may view the slides and follow along with the teacher's presentation. The students can then annotate the slides by adding digital "ink". These annotations can then be shared with the teacher and other students in the class. 

This project was originally developed by WIlliam Burnside, Brian Mayton, Mathia Klous, and Krisofer Plunkett as a capstone project at the University of Washington. The OLPC at UW club has now taken over development.

This README will be updated as goals for this project are decided.
