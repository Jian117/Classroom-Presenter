# Japanese translations for Classroom Presenter for XO package.

# This file is distributed under the same license as the Classroom Presenter package.

#
# This is an example translation to test that localization works in Classroom Presenter.
# The actual translation is probably dubious; I'm using a dictionary for a few of these
# terms.  It'd be great if someone more fluent than I could make corrections here...
